## Description

Project is as much RWD friendly as I could do in such short period of time.

There are couple of features like selecting, sorting, deleting and adding elements to the list.

I care about tests so feel free to run it. I couldn't develop all of the functionalities but I am sure that it is enough to show my JS skills.
